-Lip Reading AI

-Lip Reading AI is a deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that translates lip movements into text. It utilizes TensorFlow and the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to recognize spoken words without audio.

-Features


Converts silent video input into text using deep learning.

Uses TensorFlow for model training.

Implements CTC loss for alignment-free sequence prediction.

Leverages OpenCV for video preprocessing.

Supports GPU acceleration.


-Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install opencv-python matplotlib imageio gdown tensorflow

-Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LipReadingAI.git
cd LipReadingAI

-Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to process videos and train the model:
jupyter notebook
